Project Title: Sprint 9 Project/ Machine Learning In Business 

Project Description: I will be using Machine Learning in order to create a machine learning model in order to help the OilyGiant mining company (hypothetical company) 
find the best well. This project contains information for Regions 0, 1, and 2 for the OilyGiant mining company. In this project, I will be using a Linear Regression model 
in order to find which of the 3 regions listed is the most profitable for the OilyGiant mining company. This project involves calculating the estimated profit for each region 
using a Linear Regression Model and then using the bootstrapping to revaluate the average estimed profit once again from a dataset of 1000 bootstrapped samples with replacement. 

Task Presented For The Project: 

You work for the OilyGiant mining company. 

Your task is to find the best place for a new well.

Steps to choose the location:

Collect the oil well parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves;

Build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells;

Pick the oil wells with the highest estimated values;

Pick the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells.

You have data on oil samples from three regions. Parameters of each oil well in the region are already known. 
Build a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin. Analyze potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique.
